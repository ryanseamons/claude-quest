```

An interactive course that teaches kids (ages 10+) how to use AI tools to build real projects. No prior coding experience needed.

**Live Site:** [claudequest.ryanseamons.com](https://claudequest.ryanseamons.com)

## The Goal

Give kids the basic tools that unlock their ability to **build anything they can imagine**. Instead of teaching programming syntax, this course teaches kids how to:

- Talk to AI assistants effectively (prompting)
- Use the terminal (the "secret" way pros control computers)
- Turn ideas into working web apps
- Iterate and improve their creations

By the end, kids will have built multiple interactive projects and have the confidence to create more on their own.

## What You'll Learn

| Level | Name | What You'll Do |
|-------|------|----------------|
| 1 | **Terminal Basics** | Learn to control your computer with text commands |
| 2 | **Meet Claude** | Install Claude Code and set up your AI coding partner |
| 3 | **Your First Prompts** | Build 6 web apps by describing what you want |
| 4 | **Level Up** | Make your projects better with styling, sounds, and features |
| 5 | **Boss Level** | Design and build your dream project from scratch |

---

## How It Works

This is a **gamified, browser-based course** with:

- XP and leveling system to track progress
- Interactive terminal simulator for safe practice
- Copy-paste prompts to use with Claude Code
- Achievement badges for completing challenges
- Platform-specific instructions (Mac/Windows/Linux)

Kids work through levels at their own pace, building real projects they can show off.

## Course Philosophy

**AI prompting is the new literacy.** Just as typing unlocked computers for a generation, knowing how to effectively communicate with AI unlocks a new level of creative power.

This course doesn't teach kids to memorize syntax—it teaches them to **describe what they want** and iterate until they get it. That's a skill that will remain valuable regardless of how AI tools evolve.
