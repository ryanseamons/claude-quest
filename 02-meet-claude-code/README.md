# Level 2: Meet Claude Code - Your AI Coding Companion

## Mission Briefing

Remember how in Level 1 you learned to talk to your computer? Well, now you're going to meet someone who can help you code: **Claude Code**!

Claude is an AI (Artificial Intelligence) that understands what you want to build and helps you create it. It's like having a super-smart coding buddy who never gets tired of your questions!

---

## What is Claude Code?

Claude Code is a tool that lets you:
- Ask questions about coding in plain English
- Build projects by describing what you want
- Fix problems when code doesn't work
- Learn new things by exploring together

**It's like having a conversation with a coding expert who can actually write code for you!**

---

## Starting Claude Code

First, make sure you're in your code-quest folder:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/code-quest
```

Then type:

```bash
claude
```

You should see Claude Code start up! It will look something like:

```
╭─────────────────────────────────────╮
│  Welcome to Claude Code!            │
│  Type your message to get started   │
╰─────────────────────────────────────╯
>
```

---

## Your First Conversation

Type this (or something similar) and press Enter:

```
Hi! I'm learning to code. Can you tell me something cool about programming?
```

Claude will respond! This is how easy it is to talk to your AI assistant.

## What Can You Ask Claude?

Here are some great starter prompts:

### Ask Questions:
- "What is a variable in programming?"
- "Why do programmers use something called 'functions'?"
- "What's the difference between Python and JavaScript?"

### Ask for Help:
- "Can you explain what this code does?" (then paste some code)
- "I'm getting an error that says [error message]. What does it mean?"
- "How do I make a program that asks for my name?"

### Ask to Build Things:
- "Can you help me create a simple number guessing game?"
- "Let's make a program that tells jokes"
- "I want to build a to-do list"

---

## Talking to Claude: Pro Tips

### Be Specific
Instead of: "Make me a game"
Try: "Make me a number guessing game where I have to guess a number between 1 and 10"

### Ask Follow-Up Questions
- "Can you explain that part again?"
- "What does that line do?"
- "Can you make it simpler?"

### Don't Be Shy!
- There are no dumb questions
- Claude loves to explain things
- If you don't understand, just ask again
