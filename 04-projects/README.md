## How to Work on Bigger Projects

### Step 1: Start Simple
Ask Claude to create the basic version first. Don't try to add everything at once!

### Step 2: Test It
Run your program. Does it work? Play with it!

### Step 3: Add Features
One at a time, ask Claude to add new features:
"Now can you add [feature] to the game?"

### Step 4: Fix Problems
If something breaks, tell Claude:
"When I do [thing], it gives me this error: [error]. Can you fix it?"

### Step 5: Make It Yours
Add your own creative touches! Ask Claude:
"Can you change [thing] to [your idea]?"

## The Secret to Great Projects

**Start small, then grow!**

The best programmers don't write perfect code the first time. They:
1. Make something simple that works
2. Test it
3. Add one thing
4. Test it again
5. Repeat!

This is called "iterating" and it's how all software is built!
